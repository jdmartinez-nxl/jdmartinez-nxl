### Hey, there

I'm Juan and I'm a backend senior developer in SWAT 1 team at [Nextlane](https://github.com/Nextlane-R-D). I love building things using [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) and learn new stuff every day.

## My job

- **I'm currently working on**: A lot of cloud use cases using microservices architecture, DDD, and some other exciting stuff.
- **Ask me about**: .NET, DDD, CQRS, RESTful APIs, SQL databases, software architecture, design datterns, desting, and more...
- **How to reach me**: Reach out and connect with me on Microsoft Teams.

## My hobbies

You can also check it out my [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/jdmartinez) where you can find other cool C# stuff, like: 

- **[Functional](https://github.com/jdmartinez/Functional)**. Nuget package with some functional types.
- **[Notion Movie Updater](https://github.com/jdmartinez/notion-movie-updater)**. A simple experiment about how to use GitHub Actions to schedule and running an application.
