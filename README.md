### Hey, there

I'm Juan and I'm a backend senior developer at [@](https://github.com/Nextlane-R-D). I love building things using [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) and learn new stuff every day.

## My job

- **I'm currently working on**: A lot of cloud use cases using microservices, DDD, and some other exciting stuff
- **Ask me about**: .NET, DDD, CQRS, RESTful APIs, SQL Databases, Software Architecture, Design Patterns, Testing, and a lot more...
- **How to reach me**: Reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn!

## My hobbies

You can also check it out my [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/jdmartinez) where you can find other cool C# stuff, like: 

- **[Functional](https://github.com/jdmartinez/Functional)**. Nuget package with some functional types.
- **[Notion Movie Updater](https://github.com/jdmartinez/notion-movie-updater)**. A simple experiment about how to use GitHub Actions to schedule and running an application.

<!--
**jdmartinez-nxl/jdmartinez-nxl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
